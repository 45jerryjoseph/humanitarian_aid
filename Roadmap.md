In the humanitarian logistics system, the Admin User serves as the central representative of the Red Cross organization, overseeing the entire supply chain and managing user roles and permissions. The Warehouse Manager is responsible for processing items within the warehouse, including inventory management, shipment preparation, and coordinating with drivers and field workers to ensure smooth operations. The Field Worker and Driver roles are closely associated, as a Driver ID can be assigned to a Field Worker when direct collaboration or delivery support is required. Additionally, the system integrates Distributor Companies, which act as suppliers providing essential goods to the warehouses. This collaborative workflow ensures transparency, efficiency, and accountability across all stages of the supply chain, from sourcing items to delivering them to those in need.

When the project is operational, the flow of activities and interactions can be outlined as follows:

    Admin User Initialization
        The Admin User sets up the system by onboarding users such as Warehouse Managers, Field Workers, Drivers, and Distributor Companies.
        The Admin also manages permissions, oversees inventory levels, and monitors overall logistics operations.

    Item Supply and Warehouse Processing
        Distributor Companies supply goods to the Warehouse Manager, who logs the items into the inventory system.
        The Warehouse Manager organizes items, categorizes them, and prepares shipments based on requests or planned distributions.

    Shipment Assignment and Preparation
        The Warehouse Manager creates shipment tasks and assigns a Driver to transport the items.
        If field support is required, a Field Worker is associated with the shipment and linked to the Driver via their ID for coordination.

    Item Transportation and Delivery
        The Driver picks up the assigned shipment and begins transportation, with real-time tracking recorded in the system.
        At the destination, the Field Worker confirms delivery, manages last-mile logistics, and resolves any issues on-site.

    Feedback and Updates
        Field Workers and Drivers update shipment statuses (e.g., in-transit, delivered) in real-time.
        Any discrepancies, such as damaged goods or delays, are reported back to the system for review by the Warehouse Manager or Admin.

    Monitoring and Optimization
        The Admin User and Logistics Coordinators monitor the entire process through dashboards, tracking shipments, inventory levels, and user performance.
        Feedback from Drivers and Field Workers helps optimize future operations, such as route planning and inventory distribution.
